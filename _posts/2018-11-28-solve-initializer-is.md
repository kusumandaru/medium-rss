Sometimes, you need load connection on db using initializer/ on Ruby on rails. For some environment like test and development itâ€™s fine. But when we try to deploy on production which make lazy load turn on. it call to database. and throw message like this.

    0m[91mMysql2::Error: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2 "No such file or directory")

To avoid this only on rake assets, we search where file [located](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/blob/master/lib/sprockets/rails/task.rb). than we skip using !defined?(selected_class)

Finally, when we running rake assets:precompile, we skip block code to execute.
