<p>Compare pricing and function for GCP Southeast Asia</p><p>For previous year, GCP asia southeast region only have Singapore as data centre, for nowadays Jakarta region is become new member of southeast. It will give privileges for Financial institution to deploy application and data center inside indonesia to comply with regulation of Personally identifiable information. Also reduce network latency rather than region outside indonesia. Jakarta now becomes one of 24 regions and 73 zones along 17 countries with served by google cloud.</p><p><em>Regions</em> are independent geographic areas that consist of <em>zones</em>. Locations within regions tend to have round-trip network latencies of under &lt;1ms on the 95th percentile. For example jakarta located on asia-southeast2 and have 3 zone asia-southeast2-a, asia-southeast2-b, and asia-southeast2-c</p><p>Jakarta region provides services such of Compute engine, Kubernetes, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, BigTable and bigQuery. Hybrid customer also can have direct link via Dedicated Interconnect service.</p><p>We try to compare based on these article written date (8–6–2020). Also <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator">google pricing calculator</a> still not updated yet.
